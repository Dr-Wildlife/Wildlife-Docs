This bluebird is just as “western” as the Western Bluebird, but the two species occupy different habitats in summer. 
The Western is more of a forest bird, the Mountain more partial to open habitats: high sagebrush desert, mountain meadows, and even alpine tundra. 
This is also known as the statebird of Nevada, America as the citizens are able to see this often flying around.
Potentially severe loss of current summer range by 2080, as projected by Audubon's climate model, may be most acute at high elevations, where meadows and tundra are widely expected to suffer from climate change. 
Conversely, suitable climate space is forecast to potentially expand in winter, a result consistent with the Mountain Bluebird’s habitat preferences at that time of year.

The mountain bluebird is 15.5–18 cm (6.1–7.1 in) in length, weighs 24–37 g (0.85–1.31 oz), and has a wingspan of 11.0-14.2 in (28-36 cm).
It is sexually dimorphic in the color of the plumage but the sexes are similar in size. 
An adult male is bright turquoise-blue above and somewhat lighter blue underneath but with a white lower belly. 
An adult female has duller blue wings and tail, grey breast, grey crown, throat and back. 
In fresh fall plumage, the female's throat and breast are brownish near the flank, contrasting with white tail underparts.
Their call is a thin 'few', while their song is warbled high 'chur chur'.
