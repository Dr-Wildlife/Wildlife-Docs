The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, currently ranging only in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. 
It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. 
It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a more prominent mane that usually obscures the ears and extends to the shoulders.

The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. 
It is an apex and keystone predator, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. 
It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 
It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
A lion pride consists of related females and cubs, and a few or one adult male who is unrelated to the females. 
Groups of female lions usually hunt together. Adult males often compete to keep or gain that membership in the pride.

The Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around 10.8 million years ago. 
Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago.
The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene.
The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old.
